# Glossary of Terms 
## A.	Draft Definitions of terms used in this report
 **AR Cloud**: A 3D digital copy (representation) of the physical world that enables persistent overlays of augmented reality experiences that can be shared with many users and devices.

A one or multi-tiered layer of digital constructs that can exist as many composite bits and bytes of information architecture. By linking this data to the real world spaces, and places we can accurately represent the world and objects around us in digital formats desired by the system designer.

### From VRARA whitepaper :
> The AR Cloud is a continuously updated collection of machine-readable datasets, primarily sparse or dense point clouds plus a feature descriptor and other meta-data for each point or groups of points. AR Cloud data is any dataset which can aid in accurately determining the position and pose of AR-enabled devices, semantically understanding the scene and positioning digital content in physical spaces (this can include polygonal geometry, visual descriptors, images, video, ‘simple geographic features’, etc).
> Because of the ever-changing nature of real-world spaces, the AR Cloud must constantly be updated with new data to enable AR devices to accurately localize within these dynamically changing environments. AR Cloud data is crowdsourced from an array of technologies (sparse slam maps, point clouds, occlusion meshes, photorealistic textures, BIM data) and versioned to reflect multiple states including time of day, environment changes, weather or lighting changes.

**Open AR Cloud**: An organization dedicated to promoting the development of open and interoperable spatial computing standards.

**Digital Thread** - describes the framework which connects data flows and produces a holistic view of an asset's data across its product lifecycle. This framework addresses protocols, security, and standards. Typically, the digital thread connects digital twins, digital models of physical assets, or groups of assets. [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_thread)]

**Digital Transformation** - is the novel use of digital technology to solve traditional problems. These digital solutions enable inherently new types of innovation and creativity, rather than simply enhance and support traditional methods. [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation)]

**Industry 4.0** : term for current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. It includes cyber-physical systems (CPS), the Internet of things (IoT), cloud computing and cognitive computing. Industry 4.0 is commonly referred to as the fourth industrial revolution. [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0)]

**Reality**- In the instance of ARcloud reality is defined as objects that have physical substance and existence in the world

**Real Object** - A real object or a marker is a feature or artefact in the real world that is used to anchor an augmentation in a composed scene. This includes natural features such as buildings and landmarks, artefacts such as posters, book covers or pictures, and markers such as barcodes, 2d matrix codes and other machine readable patterns. 

**Spatial Mapping** - The process of capturing the physical structures and the spatial relationships between these structures of a real space into a spatial map. (as defined by OARC)

**Spatial Map** - A data structure representing the physical structures contained in a real space and the spatial relationships between them. Usually in the form of a three-dimensional point cloud or a three-dimensional mesh. (as defined by OARC)

**Semantic Network (Graph)**- a knowledge base that represents semantic relations between concepts in a network. This is often used as a form of knowledge representation. It is a directed or undirected graph consisting of vertices, which represent concepts, and edges, which represent semantic relations between concepts,[1] mapping or connecting semantic fields. [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_network)]

**Semantic Scene Understanding** - Scene understanding, in contrast to object recognition, attempts to analyze objects in context with respect to the 3D structure of the scene, its layout, and the spatial, functional, and semantic relationships between objects. [[source](https://ps.is.tue.mpg.de/research_fields/semantic-scene-understanding)]

**Reality Mapping** - The process of combining Spatial Maps and Semantic Scene Understanding into an indexed data collection. See Reality Graph (as defined by OARC)

**Reality Graph** - A graph data structure, in which the state and positions of objects and the geometric and semantic relationships between those objects located in reality are described. (as defined by OARC)

**Cognitive Map** - is a type of mental representation which serves an individual to acquire, code, store, recall, and decode information about the relative locations and attributes of phenomena in their everyday or metaphorical spatial environment. [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_map)]

**Spatial Analysis** - includes any of the formal techniques which study entities using their topological, geometric, or geographic properties. [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_analysis)]

**Spatial Index** - lets define it :)

**Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO)** - a method for determining a devices pose in a physical space using a combination of cameras and motion sensors.

**Universal Scene Description** - is an efficient, scalable system for authoring, reading, and streaming time-sampled scene description for interchange between graphics applications. [[source](http://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/index.html)]

2. Sources for terms about AR (not exclusively on AR Cloud)

In 2010 a group of ~50 people convened to discuss activities towards open and interoperable AR and brainstormed a set of AR “word clouds” (terms that were/are thematically related in AR). 

The traces of that exercise are found here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WsrUOkwNscJ3DB0NK0Zaa37coLUjALba322R_Nv4ASs/edit?authkey=CLvx3LkK#gid=0

We kept working on it in 2011 and eventually (May 2012) published this
https://www.perey.com/ARStandards/ar-glossary-v-2-2/
Unfortunately, the domain models map which connects all the terms, is no longer available.

In 2014 there was an analysis of the differences between the May 2012 glossary and the terms proposed for use in the MAR Reference Model. The results of that exercise are here http://www.perey.com/ARStandards/ar-terminology-and-glossaries/ 

We may want to review this (and to refer to the author of the post as a source, if any of the definitions there are used): https://next.reality.news/how-to/quick-dirty-guide-augmented-reality-terms-you-need-know-0182665/

-	This page is a good reference and does indeed maintain close to current understanding of related terminology. Recommend we add to a more complete repository for the core site. We should also attempt to locate original authors.

Here are a couple of existing glossaries published with a VR angle

3. Terms to Be Reviewed/Placed by Glossary editors in Appropriate Category:

In addition to terms (don't know who submitted them) under the section heading "Related Terminology That Describes Or Relates To Elements In The Cloud") other terms Christine proposes to be added to the glossary PLEASE ADD YOUR DEFINITION if you have one!: 

-	In Real Life (IRL) - 

-	In Digital Life (IDL)

**Composed Scene**: A composed scene is produced by a system of sensors, displays, and interfaces that creates a perception of reality where augmentations are integrated into the real world.

In an augmented reality system a composed scene is a manifestation of a real-world environment and one or more rendered digital assets. It does not necessarily involve 3D objects or even visual rendering.
The acquisition of the user (or device) ’s current pose is required to align the composed scene to the user’s perspective.
Examples of composed scenes with visual rendering (AR in camera view) include a smartphone application that presents a visualisation through the handheld video display, or a webcam-based system where the real object and augmentation are displayed on a PC monitor.
Note: A composed scene is different from the terminology used in 3D modeling, where the 3D scene simply describes camera angle and lighting but is often divorced entirely from a real-world environment.

**Visual localization** (as another sub-term in the broader "Localization" section)

**Indoor**- could define it as a spatial volume that is characterized by planar surfaces without texture (but that would not work for a mine shaft), also, for indoors we can generalize about some cellular and satellite services (GPS) not being consistently available? Semantically, having a roof above you that obstructs access to satellites (eg., in a mine shaft, in a train station, under surface of a body of water)

**Indoor Localization** - The user’s AR device cannot rely exclusively or consistently on GPS for position and so there are other methods for localization. 

**Outdoor** - a space which can be private or public (shared, multipurpose) and which can use cellular and satellite services (GPS) consistently (except where not available). Does it make sense to define 

**Urban Canyon** (as a subtype of both indoor and outdoor types of spaces)

**Private Digital Model** - this is a case in which the spatial index or model is not public (indoors a home or a factory floor)

**Visual Inertial Odometry**: Visual Odometry means estimating the 3D pose (translation + orientation) of a moving camera relative to its starting position, using visual features.

**Scene Parsing**: [ Definition Needed. Is this different from scene segmentation?]

**Real World Target**: _This typically refers to a real object that exists in the physical world and on or near which a digital object can be placed in the space using the target as positional placement._ 

**Edge Computing**

**Decentralized or distributed spatial index** _(are they different and if so, how?)_

**Decentralized or distributed processing, data storage**

**Spatial History or Spatial Memory** refers to tracking what was there in the real world before

**Geospatial Anchors** _(should be with Spatial Anchors section in Michael's list)_

**Geographic coverage** (e.g., of a network for connectivity)

**Bandwidth** (as in for connectivity) should be somehow related to latency (on which there is a lot to say)

These proposed definitions for "Semantic segmentation" and "Scene segmentation" are currently in WG1 chapter draft (sources for these are cited there). I just pasted them in here:
-	Semantic segmentation is a process performed on images to recognize and understand the image’s content at the pixel-level. (CP: doesn’t define what the terms “recognize” and “understand” mean)
-	
-	The definition of Scene segmentation is the task of splitting a scene into its various object components.

**Outside-in tracking**: using external cameras or sensors to detect motion and track positioning. This method offers more precision tracking, but a drawback is the external sensors lower the portability. Example: HTC Vive
 
**Inside-out tracking**: uses cameras or sensors located within the device itself to track its position in the real world space. This method requires more hardware in the AR device, but offers more portability. Example – Microsoft HoloLens
 
**Breaking immersion**: when the sense of realism has been broken; in AR this is usually by an object behaving in a way that does not match our expectations.
 
**Placing**: when the tracking of a digital object is fixed, or anchored, to a certain point in the real world.
 
**Scaling**: when a placed AR object changes size and/or dimension relative to the AR device's position. For example, when a user moves away or towards an AR object, it feels like the object is getting larger or smaller depending on the distance of the phone in relation to the object. AR objects further away from the phone look smaller and objects that are closer look larger. This should mimic the depth perception of human eyes.
 
**Feature points**: Visually distinct features in the environment, like the edge of a chair, a light switch on a wall, the corner of a table, or any other object that will stay visible and in the same consistent location during an AR experience
 
**Pose / GeoPose**:  the position and orientation of any object in relation to the world around it. Everything has its own unique pose, from the AR device to the augmented 3D asset that is seen on the display.
 
**Occlusion**: when one object (3D or real world) blocks another object from a user’s field of view or camera perspective
 
**Spatial mapping**: the ability to create a 3D map of the environment and helps establish where assets can be placed.

**Anchors** - user-defined points of interest upon which AR objects are placed. Anchors are created and updated relative to real world geometry (planes, points, etc.) detected in the environment
 
**Light estimation**: the process that allows the AR device to estimate the environment's current lighting conditions for sharing AR assets appropriately

**Light field rendering** techniques focus on the reconstruction of complex lighting and material attributes from a set of input images rather than the exact reconstruction of geometric details. 
The light field is a vector function that describes the amount of light flowing in every direction through every point in given space.

**SLAM**, Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) is a series of complex computations and algorithms which use sensor data to construct a map of an unknown environment while using it at the same time to identify where it is located. SLAM algorithms combine data from sensors to determine the position of each sensor OR process data received from it and build a map of the surrounding environment.

**ORB-SLAM** is a versatile and accurate SLAM solution for Monocular, Stereo and RGB-D cameras. It is able to compute in real-time the camera trajectory and a sparse 3D reconstruction of the scene in a wide variety of environments, ranging from small hand-held sequences of a desk to a car driven around several city blocks. It is able to close large loops and perform global relocalisation in real-time and from wide baselines. It includes an automatic and robust initialization from planar and non-planar scenes.

**Surface detection** developed for smartphones relies on algorithms, libraries, and drivers that combine specific feature sets and vision sensors on each device. Higher-end CV approaches can include infrared and LIDAR which send out a light beam and time its return to create a 3D map of real-world space.

**Layers** A shared open spatial web where any user can find content demands many new conventions of sorting.
Users will need methods for filtering what they want to see follow or avoid in the AR society.

**Latency** is the delay between action and reaction. Having low latency is crucial when using a Head-mounted Display for AR. As you move your head, your HMD should display the resulting changes immediately.

**High Latency** in AR can cause virtual content to be misaligned with real life features.

**Digital Twin** as a bridge between the physical and digital world. Simply put, a digital twin can be best described as a ‘Virtual model of a product, service or a process’.

**Snapping** refers to automatically aligning. Or referring to a guide.
●	Snap to object ( a couch fits evenly next to the edge of a table)
●	Snap to environment ( a couch sits even on top of a rug)
●	Snap to guide ( a table is entered in the middle of a rug)

**Guides**:
Cage:  A 3D boundary that references the volume, scale,
            and shape of something
Shadow: Represents proximity and how far or close something is.
Guide: Lines or cues that reprints alignment and proximity.
Gizmo: A visual indicator for movement rotation or scale – useful for when
            A user can only do a single action.
Parameter: A reference to the degree and value of change.

**Spatial Sound/Audio**
When objects are out of our line of sight, one of the ways that we can perceive what's going on around us is through sound. Given that  are hologram objects made of light and sometimes sound, the sound component helps ground holograms making them more believable and creating a more immersive experience.
By analysing how sound reaches both our ears, our brain determines the distance and direction of the object emitting the sound. An HRTF (or Head Related Transfer Function) simulates this interaction by modelling the spectral response that characterises how an ear receives sound from a point in space. The spatial audio engine uses personalised HRTFs to expand the mixed reality experience, and simulate sounds that are coming from various directions and distances.

**Black Mirror Scenario**
the morality tales of Black Mirror tend to shine a light on the darker corners of technology and the sociological risks hidden therein. How can we 
prevent a future which seems to be taken Straight out of the. Netflix Science Fiction show Black Mirror we don't want to wake up and find ourselves in an Spatial Web nightmare.
Thin line to walk 
will we find our AR devices that could benefit from real time visual censoring of content in live video streams.

**Hyper Reality** 
In its original context, hyperreality has connotations of a dystopian future - one in which we crave reality, but in the attempt to achieve it,  we fabricate a false version and consume that as real instead ( by French sociologist Jean Baudrillard and further explored by Italian Author Umberto Eco)

**Eye Tracking**
Eye Tracking is the measurement of eye activity. While there are many different types of non-intrusive eye trackers, they generally include two common components: a light source and a camera. The light source is directed towards the eye. The camera tracks the reflection of the light source along with visible ocular features such as the pupi. This data is used to extrapolate the rotation of the eye and ultimately the direction of gaze.

**Facial Tracking**
Facial tracking is a computer vision technology designed to obtain data from still images and video sequences by tracking certain facial features in real-time. While this technology has been used in motion capturing using facial markers, currently it is widely implemented in augmented reality (AR) experiences using a marker less mode. For example, face tracking can be used to perceive head poses and facial expressions, rendering the information obtained to an application that applies specific face filters. A camera is used to map and track facial landmarks in real-time.

**3D reconstruction**
The process of capturing the shape and appearance of real objects. This process can be accomplished either by active or passive methods.If the model is allowed to change its shape in time, this is referred to as non-rigid or spatio-temporal reconstruction

**Autonomous vehicles** are vehicles capable of sensing their environment and navigating without human input.

**Accessible design** allows users of all abilities to navigate, understand, and use your UI successfully.

**Accessibility **provides access to a system or experience to all people, regardless of disability type or severity of impairment.  When necessary, modifications should be considered to accommodate all major categories of disabilities: visual, hearing, motor, cognitive and emotional.

**Barrier** _(needs to be paraphrased)_
Disablility Barriers
The social model of disability suggests disability is caused by the way society is organized, rather than by a person’s impairment. This model suggests barriers in society are created by ableism. When barriers are removed, people with disabilities can be independent and equal in society.
There are three main types of barriers:[5]
1.	**Attitudinal barriers**: are created by people who see only disability when associating with people with disabilities in some way. These attitudinal barriers can be witnessed through bullying, discrimination, and fear. These barriers include low expectations of people with disabilities. These barriers contribute to all other barriers.[5][6][7] Attitudes towards people with disabilities in low and middle-income countries can be even more extreme.[8]
2.	**Environmental barriers**: inaccessible environments, natural or built, create disability by creating barriers to inclusion.
3.	**Institutional barriers**: include many laws, policies, practices, or strategies that discriminate against people with disabilities. For example, a study of five Southeast Asian countries found that electoral laws do not specially protect the political rights of persons with disabilities, while ‘some banks do not allow visually disabled people to open accounts, and HIV testing centers often refuse to accept sign language interpreters due to confidentiality policies’.[9] Restrictive laws exist in some countries, particularly affecting people with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities.[10]
Other barriers include: internalised barriers (low expectations of people with disabilities can undermine their confidence and aspirations), inadequate data and statistics, lack of participation and consultation of disabled people.

**Billboarding** is a behavioral concept that can be applied to objects in mixed reality. Objects with billboarding always orient themselves to face the user, by can rotating freely in the user's environment.  [ from Microsoft Hololens Documentation ] 

**Constructivism** is basically a theory -- based on observation and scientific study -- about how people learn. It says that people construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world, through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences.

**Contextual inquiry** is an interview method used to obtain information about the context of a given use case. The practice is to engage with users while they work naturally in their environment. Much can be observed about the user, both intended and unintended who may be affected by the augmentation, as well as physical characteristic and qualities of the environment itself.  

** The Curb-Cut Effect**
Laws and programs designed to benefit vulnerable groups, such as the disabled or people of color, often end up benefiting all of society.
(more info [https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_curb_cut_effect](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_curb_cut_effect))
The lessons learned from the Curb-Cut Effect are invaluable for the future of immersive technologies. By prioritising accessibility in this generation of AR, developers and creatives alike can ensure that those concepts are firmly rooted in the medium pushing forward.

**Disability**
The ADA defines a person with a disability as a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity. This includes people who have a record of such an impairment, even if they do not currently have a disability. It also includes individuals who do not have a disability but are regarded as having a disability. The ADA also makes it unlawful to discriminate against a person based on that person’s association with a person with a disability. 
[https://adata.org/faq/what-definition-disability-under-ada](https://adata.org/faq/what-definition-disability-under-ada)

**Embodiment**
A tangible or visible form of an idea, quality, or feeling
(Oxford Dictionary)

**Fiducial marker**
used as a fixed standard of reference for comparison or measurement

**Haptic**
The use of technology that stimulates the senses of touch and motion, especially to reproduce in remote operation or computer simulation the sensations that would be felt by a user interacting directly with physical objects.

**Human Factors** deal with trying to successfully engineer a system with the user and their needs in mind. The Human Factors and Ergonomics Society defines Human Factors as a “scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system and the profession that applies theory, principle, data and other methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance” 
(Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, 2000) 
Human Factors uses various methods to understand what the user needs from a system.  

**Human-centered design (HCD)** is a term product creators use to describe a process of designing for people. HCD develops solutions to problems by involving the human perspective in all steps of the problem solving process. (4 fundamental principles of HCD)
●	Focus upon the people
●	Find the right problem
●	Think of everything as a system
●	Always test your design decisions

**Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs)** are activities related to independent living and are valuable for evaluating persons with early-stage disease, both to assess the level of disease and to determine the person's ability to care for himself or herself.

**Immersion** is achieved by removing as many real world sensations as possible, and substituting these with the sensations provided by the techmnology.

**Inclusion** ensures that we understand and account for diverse user needs, and make no assumptions about an average user. That we are designing for differences in:
●	Access to information and technology
●	Language and cultural understanding
●	Socio-economic standing
●	Age, gender, and identity
●	Experience and ability
●	Location

**Journey Map (User Journey Map)** is a visualization of an individual’s relationships with a product/experience/brand over time and across different channels.
While user journey maps come in all shapes and formats, commonly it’s represented as a timeline of all touch points between a user and a product. This timeline contains information about all channels that users use to interact wiht a product.
User Journey maps are an excellent tool for UX designers because they visualize how a user interacts with a product/experience and allows creatives to see a product/experience form a user’s perspective/point of view. This fosters a more user-centric approach to product design, which ultimately lead to better user experience.


**Hologram, Holographic** 
A 3-dimensional data set that is either animated or volumetrically captured intended to mimic reality.  It is a visual phenomenon experienced through a special holographic projector or is played via in a real-time game engine and displayed in a virtual, mixed or augmented reality experience be realistically viewed from any angle or location.

**Mental Model**
A mental model is a way to enhance your cognitive apparatus in order to make more intelligent and strategic decisions. (Why Model)

**Multisensory Experience**

**Personas** are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research (user research) in order to represent the different user types that might be used in a similar way. Personas can support achieving the goal of creating a good user experience for the target user group.

**Photogrammetry** is the science of making measurements from photographs. It is used to create a 3-dimensional model of a real-world object or scene from a series of 2 dimensional images. If the scale of the image is known, the distance between two points that lie on a plane parallel to the photographic image plane, can be determined by measuring their distance on the image.

**Presence** indicates how much the user feels engaged with a virtual experience, how much they feel that experience as a real experience.

**Ready Player One**

**Safety**
The condition of being protected from or unlikely to cause danger, risk, or injury. 
(Oxford Dictionary)

**Safety in the Term of AR**
Users can get too immersed in an AR experience and can get distracted from/ignore real world hazards around them if not properly alerted. Think about where your app/experience is directing the user’s attention. 

**Screen door effect** 
Is a visual artifact that has a mesh-like appearance.  It occurs where visible gaps, appearing as fine lines, between pixels are seen on a display. These usually arise when viewing at close proximity. The artifcat becomes much less significant as display resolutions increase.

**SDF**
Signed-Distance Field, which is a precomputed representation of a font atlas that stores the glyph outlines implicitly. Distance fields are useful in a variety of graphics applications, including antialiasing, ray marching, and texture synthesis. Sometimes they are computed analytically from functions, but often they are generated from voxelized meshes or 2D bitmaps.

**Smart Cities** use information and communication technology (ICT) to enhance livaiblity, workability and sustainablility 

**Tag-along** is a behavioral concept that can be added to holograms, including billboarded objects. This interaction is a more natural and friendly way of achieving the effect of head-locked content. A tag-along object attempts to never leave the user's view. This allows the user to freely interact with what is front of them while also still seeing the holograms outside their direct view. [ [from Microsoft Hololens Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/billboarding-and-tag-along)] 

**Task analysis** is the process of learning about users by observing them in action to understand in detail how they perform their tasks and achieve their intended goals.
Tasks analysis helps identify the tasks that your website, application and experience must support and can also help you refine or re-define your site's/experience navigation or search by determining the appropriate content scope 
Purpose of Task Analysis are? (content from Book User and Task Analysis for Interface Design, JoAnn Hackos and Janice Redish)
●	What your users’ goals are; what they are trying to achieve
●	What users actually do to achieve those goals
●	What experiences (personal, social and cultural) users bring to the tasks
●	How users are influenced by their physical environment
●	How users’ previous knowledge and experience influence:
-	How they think about their work
-	The workflow they follow to perform their tasks

**Tesla Suit**

**Transformative Technologies** are medically and scientifically validated technologies supporting mental health, wellbeing and thriving that leverage technology to expand human joy and possibility. 

**Unity**

**Usability**
Usability is part of the brader term “user experience” and refers to the ease of access and/or use of a product or website. 
The official ISO 9241-11 definition of usability is. “The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals effectiveness, efficiencx and satisfaction in a specified context of use.”

**Use Case**
A use Case is a written description of how users will perform tasks in your Experience/Product.
It outlines from a user’s point of view, a system’s behavior as it responds a request.
Each use case is represented as a sequence of simple steps, beginning with a user’s goal and ending  when that goal is fulfilled. 
●	Who is using the Experience/Product
●	What does the user want to do
●	The user’s  goal
●	The steps the user takes to accomplish a particular task
●	How the website should respond to an action

**User/End User**
In IT, the term end user is used to distinguish the person for whom a hardware or software product is designed from the developers, installers and services of the experience/product.
The term end user thus distinguishes the uses for which the experience/product is designed from other users who are making the experience/product possible for the enc user. Often the term user would suffice.

**User Experience (UX)**
It’s the overall experience a person has while interacting with a product such as a website, or application. It’s part of everything you interact with. UX supports the entire Customer Experience (CX). We measure user experience by how easy, intuitive, seamless, pleasant or frictionless it is.

User Experience Principle
●	Hierarchy
●	Consistency
●	Confirmation
●	User Control
●	Accessibility

**User Flow**
A user flow is a series of steps a user takes to achieve a meaningful goal.

**User Interface**
An interface is a mechanism of the interaction of the two systems. From this point a User Interface is an interface created for facilitating direct interaction between a system and a user.
On the display device, there are two common types of User interfaces
●	The command line interface (CLI), that contains text only and is used mostly by programmers
●	The graphical User Interface (GUI) which includes images, windows, icons, menus … .

**User Interface Design**
UI or User Interface design is a discipline of designing user interfaces for machines and software, with the focus on responsiveness and aesthetics, maximizing usability to foster a good user experience. UI design is typically a combination of
●	Visual Design (the look and feel)
●	Interaction Design (how it works)

**User Research**
Understanding user behaviors needs motivation through observation techniques, task analysis and other feedback methodologies. User research also defines your audience and provides essential insights on how to best meet their needs. In that term there are some questions that need to be ask to gather User Information
●	Who will use it?
●	What are they trying to accomplish?
●	What might get in their way?
●	What are their primary needs?

**Vergence-accommodation conflict** _(needs to be paraphraed)_
To view objects clearly, humans must accommodate, or adjust their eyes’ focus, to the distance of the object. At the same time, the rotation of both eyes must converge to the object’s distance to avoid seeing double images. In natural viewing, vergence and accommodation are linked. When you view something near (e.g. a housefly close to your nose) your eyes cross and accommodate to a near point. Conversely, if you view something at optical infinity (roughly starting at 6m or farther for normal vision), your eyes’ lines of sight become parallel and your eyes’ lenses accommodate to infinity.

In most head-mounted displays users will always accommodate to the focal distance of the display (to get a sharp image), but converge to the distance of the object of interest (to get a single image). When users accommodate and converge to different distances, the natural link between the two cues must be broken and this can lead to visual discomfort or fatigue.

**Volumetric Video** looks like standard video from a given viewpoint or projected onto a 2D surface, but exists volumetrically in 3D space. It is generally played back in a real-time game engine to produce a holographic effect in a virtual, mixed or augmented reality experience where it can be realistically viewed from any angle or location.

**Volumetric Video Capture**
Volumetric Video Capture is a technique that uses multiple cameras to capture 3D data of a physical location or performance in the form of volumetric video.  It is the motion capture of photogrammetry and uses computer graphic imaging, computer vision, motion capture tracking techniques to generate volumetric data in 3D space. 


**VR/AR/MR/XR**

Simply a start...
Augmented reality(AR)is an enhanced version of reality created by the use of  digital overlays on something in the real world, being viewed through a device (such as a smartphone camera) that responds dynamically to its changes. It is a technology that incorporates real time inputs from the existing world to create an output that combines both real world data and digital, interactive elements.

It is distinct from virtual reality(VR), which isolates users and shows them a fully simulated environment, comprised of entirely fabricated elements and possibly 360 degree video or other photographic imagery. 

However, both virtual and augmented reality have in common the real time, contextual response to users’ actions and interactions with the environment. (adapted from Nielsen Norman Group)
Example of helping to clarify, more on the consumer side, it’s messy so I suggest me may have an opportunity to lead here.
